<tr><td>The paper describes a library intende to privide scientific  <br>applications with a Web interface. Use of the library allows  <br>an application to be monitored and controlled using a Web browser <br>with minimal change/disruption of the the exisiting application  <br>code base. <br> <br>This SWILL library appears to be a useful tool for leveraging <br>Web browsers to monitor and control scientific applications. <br>However, beyond the idea of pckaging a Web server as a library <br>that intercepts standard I/O functions and redirects the outpur <br>to a Web page, there is not a lot of novelty and technical  <br>substance in this paper.</td>

<tr><td>The paper is interesting although I am surprised that something equivalent to SWILL does not exist already. The figures and tables were very useful.</td>

<tr><td>The paper outlines SWILL --  a scheme for attaching a web browser to a <br>running scientific application and using the browser as an output terminal. <br>To do so, the application must be made to respond to HTTP requests and to <br>format the application's output accordingly.  The paper describes, by example, <br>how MPI programs (written in C) can be modified to field HTTP requests and <br>use the requesting socket as an I/O device. <br> <br>I certainly found this paper entertaining.  The idea of turning running MPI <br>programs into web servers is a novel one, to be sure, however it isn't <br>clear what problem, exactly, this implementation strategy solves.  For <br>example, it is common for scientific applications to produce "snapshot" <br>files that get overwritten, periodically, according to where the <br>snapshots are taken in the code.  Often, these files are ascii text or <br>HTML so that they can be easily and quickly examined with a web browser. <br>By dumping the output directly to a socket (as opposed to into a file), <br>the application might save the file space used for the snapshot, but it <br>isn't at all clear that this snapshot space in a problem.  Furthermore, <br>since the SWILL model requires polling for incoming requests, output <br>can only be generated at certain points in the program's execution -- that is, <br>at certain snapshot points. <br> <br>Since the methodology seems equivalent to simply outputting data to overwritable <br>files and then viewing these files with a browser (I've even used HTML <br>refresh and server push in these cases), and since there is no clear <br>resource or implementation problem this technique seems to overcome, <br>I do not recommend this paper for publication. <br> <br> <br></td>
