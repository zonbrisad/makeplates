<h2><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
SWILL (<i><b>S</b>imple <b>W</b>eb <b>I</b>nterface <b>L</b>ink
<b>L</b>ibrary</i>) is a programming library that makes it relatively
easy to add a web interface to programs written in C and C++.  It does
this by allowing an application to function as a simple web-server to
which users can connect using a browser.
</p>

<p>
The primary use of SWILL is in highly specialized applications that
might benefit from the presence of a web interface, but which don't
fit into the standard model of a web-server or a typical internet
application.  For example, consider a long running scientific
simulation that consumes hundreds of hours of CPU time as a
non-interactive batch job.  When running such a simulation, it is
often useful to obtain intermediate results so that scientists can
monitor its progress.  Although it is possible to log into the machine
to examine log files and intermediate data files, this is often
inconvenient.  If, on the other hand, the simulation provided a tiny
web-server, a scientist could directly connect to their application to
obtain intermediate results all while kicking back at home, drinking a
brewski, and watching their WebTV.  That would be pretty cool.  Of
course, this obviously wouldn't apply to <em>all</em> scientists.
</p>

<p>
Specialized web servers can also be useful in other settings --
especially as a diagnostics and debugging tool.  For instance, a
compiler might use a little server to allow browsing of internal data
structure such as a parse trees (using the browser as a sort of cheap
debugging interface).  A web interface can also be a useful way to
interact with a very complicated runtime environment.  For example, in
a simulated hardware environment (as might be used for teaching
operating systems), a web interface could be used to enable different
modes of operation, to selectively control different features of the
hardware, or to browse internal data structures.  Similarly, small
servers can be written to provide simple network services or tools for
managing collections of machines.  In fact, there are countless other
applications that might benefit from having a simple web interface --
most of which are legal.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why?</b>
</p>

<p>
In age of freely available web-servers, application servers, and
distributed component frameworks, you might ask why a library like
SWILL is even needed.  Well, the simple answer to that question is
that these other approaches are often too bloated and excessively
complicated to be used in the small.  If you're writing an application
and you wanted to slap a web interface on it, why would you want to
link it into some enormous internet application framework?  SWILL is
an alternative that makes a lot of sense for many types of projects.
</p>

<p>
<b>A Brief History</b>
</p>

<p>
Bits and pieces of SWILL have actually been in development since 1996.
The origins are found in the Theoretical Physics Division at Los
Alamos National Laboratory where a Python-based web browser was used
to add a remote simulation monitoring capability to molecular dynamics
software running on the Connection Machine 5.  This proved to be
rather useful to the users.
</p>

<p>
The current implementation is the result of an effort to generalize
the embedded server idea into a programming library that could be used
with a wide variety of different programs.  The primary focus has been
to make something that was small, easy to use, and could be used with
minimal conceptual overhead.  We really wanted to have a server that
was completely self-contained and which didn't require any supporting
infrastructure to make it work.
</p>

<p>
Between 2005 and 2007, SWILL was ported to compile natively under
Win32 using Microsoft Visual C, and support was added for SSL (using
OpenSSL) under all tested platforms.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prerequisites</b>
</p>

<p>
To get the most out of SWILL, you should have an understanding of
basic Web concepts such as HTML, forms, and possibly CGI scripting.
SWILL does not attempt to hide the details of HTML for you -- it's
really only concerned with making it easy for an application to serve
dynamically generated documents through a web interface.  For
instance, you could also make it deliver XML if you were so inclined.
</p>

<p>
<b>What's with the name "SWILL"?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, a lot of people working on Internet software sure seem to take
themselves <em>far</em> too seriously.  Enough said.  Besides, what
else would you want to serve?
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<i>
For those who don't know the meaning of this word, the following
definitions were taken from <a href="http://www.tfd.com/swill">The
Free Dictionary</a>:
<ol>

<li>A mixture of liquid and solid food, such as table scraps, fed to
animals, especially pigs; slop.

<li>Kitchen waste; garbage.

<li>A deep draft of liquor.

<li>Nonsense; rubbish.

</ol>
</i>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>How is this related to "the Grid"?</b>
</p>

<p>
It's not.  Now, let's continue...
</p>


<h2><a name="Overview">2. Overview</a></h2>

<p>
At its core, SWILL is nothing more than a simple embedded web server.
This server provides the following set of features:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Single-threaded/single process operation (no forking, no
multithreading).

<li>Support for HTTP/1.0 GET and POST operations.

<li>Dynamic content generation.

<li>Serving of files and directories.

<li>Access to HTML form variables.

<li>Security mechanisms. IP filters, basic authentication.

<li>Request logging

<li>Extensive error handling and recovery.

<li>Support for parallelism via the MPI message passing library.

<li>Support for SSL using the OpenSSL libraries.

</ul>

<p>
Unlike a traditional web-server, SWILL is designed to be added to
existing programs.  For this reason, it is not designed to take over
your whole application nor does it rely on programming techniques that
would alter the execution model of your program.  Instead, it is
primarily designed as an add-on.
</p>

<p>
Because of the lack of concurrency (threading), SWILL is not intended
to be a replacement for a high-traffic web server, nor was SWILL
created for the purpose of creating new "internet" applications -- if
you would want to do that, you might have better luck using Apache and
PHP.  Sorry.
</p>


<h2><a name="A Simple Example">3. A Simple Example</a></h2>

<p>
Here is a very simple SWILL example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#include "swill.h"

void 
count_to_ten(FILE *f) {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       fprintf(f,"%d\n", i);
   }
}

int main() {
   swill_init(8080);
   swill_handle("ten.txt", count_to_ten, 0);
   swill_file("index.html",0);
   while (1) {
       swill_serve();
   }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
In this example, the function <tt>swill_init()</tt> is used to open a
port for the server.  The function <tt>swill_handle()</tt> registers a
C function with the server under the name <tt>ten.txt</tt>.  The
function <tt>swill_file()</tt> registers a file with the server.
</p>

<p>
After some initial setup, the program enters an infinite loop and
simply calls <tt>swill_serve()</tt> to wait for a single request.  At
this point, the server is active.
</p>

<p>
If a user uses a browser to connect to the server on port 8080 (using
a URL such as <tt>http://www.foo.com:8080/</tt>), they will get a
server response.  A request for <tt>ten.txt</tt> will invoke the
function <tt>count_to_ten()</tt> and the resulting output will show up
as the result.  Similarly, a request for <tt>index.html</tt> will
result in that file being returned.  All other requests simply
generate an error message.  In addition to this, a request for the
special file <tt>info</tt> will return a list of all registered
handlers and documents.
</p>

<p>
In many cases, this use of SWILL is not exactly what you want.  This
is because the <tt>swill_serve()</tt> function blocks until a request
is actually received -- preventing the application from doing useful
work in the meantime.  To fix this, it is more common to use
<tt>swill_poll()</tt> in some kind of processing loop like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#include "swill.h"

void 
count_to_ten(FILE *f) {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       fprintf(f,"%d\n", i);
   }
}

int main() {
   swill_init(8080);
   swill_handle("ten.txt", count_to_ten, 0);
   swill_file("index.html",0);

   for (i = 0; i < nsteps; i++) {
       swill_poll();       /* Check for an incoming request */
       ...
       ... other useful work
       ...
   }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Typically, you would insert a <tt>swill_poll()</tt> operation in
places where it made sense to temporary stop execution and service an
incoming web request.  This would depend on the underlying application
and performance issues might dictate the precise manner in which this
is done. For example, you would probably not check for requests in the
middle of a performance critical inner loop.  On the other hand, it
might make sense to check every few seconds or so.
</p>

<p>
In this example, it is important to note that SWILL is <em>not</em> in
charge of application control.  In fact, the web server is inactive
except at times when the services of SWILL are explicitly requested
using <tt>swill_serve()</tt> or <tt>swill_poll()</tt>.  This differs
from a traditional web server or application framework -- reflecting
the fact that SWILL is only an extension of your original application.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it is interesting to note that SWILL does not rely upon any
special I/O functions for producing web pages.  For example, the
function <tt>count_to_ten()</tt> simply outputs data to a standard
file using <tt>fprintf()</tt>.  Thus, it is easy to use such functions
even when the web server is not activated.  Alternatively, any
function that might produce I/O in an application can be used to
produce web pages.
</p>


<h2><a name="A More Complicated Example">4. A More Complicated Example</a></h2>

<p>
In the previous example, a function was used to produce simple text.
If you are up on your HTML, functions can also produce HTML documents
and images.  Here is an example that displays PNG images of the
Mandelbrot set using the <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd">GD
graphics library</a>.  In addition, the example uses an HTML form to
allow users to change image properties.

<blockquote>
<pre>

#include "gd.h"

/* Structure containing plot data */
typedef struct {
  double  Xmin;
  double  Xmax;
  double  Ymin;
  double  Ymax;
  int     Tolerance;
  gdImagePtr  im;
} MandelData;

/* Handler function that draws an image */

void mandel(FILE *f, MandelData *m) {
  double scalingx;
  double scalingy;
  double zr,zi,ztr,zti,cr,ci;
  double cscale;
  int    i,j,n;

  scalingx = (m-&gt;Xmax-m-&gt;Xmin)/m-&gt;im-&gt;sx;
  scalingy = (m-&gt;Ymax-m-&gt;Ymin)/m-&gt;im-&gt;sy;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; m-&gt;im-&gt;sx; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; m-&gt;im-&gt;sy; j++) {
      zr = scalingx*i + m-&gt;Xmin;
      zi = scalingy*j + m-&gt;Ymin;
      cr = zr;
      ci = zi;
      n = 0;
      while (n &lt; m-&gt;Tolerance) {
	ztr = zr*zr-zi*zi + cr;
	zti = 2*zr*zi + ci;
	zr = ztr;
	zi = zti;
	if (ztr*ztr + zti*zti &gt; 20) break;
	n = n + 1;
      }
      if (n &gt;= m-&gt;Tolerance) gdImageSetPixel(m-&gt;im,i,j,0);
      else gdImageSetPixel(m-&gt;im,i,j,(int) (n*cscale));
    }
  }
  gdImagePng(m-&gt;im,f);
}

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The example consists of two separate web pages.  The function
<tt>mandel()</tt> produces a PNG image of the Mandelbrot set and the
function <tt>mandelpage()</tt> produces an HTML page that includes an
inline version of the image as well as some links and a form for
changing the display.  Although this is a larger example, here are the
highlights:

<ul>

<li>Server output is produced using standard C I/O functions.  For
example, when an image is produced, a standard <tt>FILE *</tt> object
is simply passed to an appropriate function in the graphics library.

<li>When handlers are registered with the server, an optional data
item can be supplied. For example, information about the current image
is stored in a structure <tt>MandelData</tt>.  When the program
starts, it creates one of these objects which is then supplied to
SWILL when handler functions are registered using
<tt>swill_handle()</tt>.  On subsequent requests, this object is then
passed to handler functions as a second argument.  This style of
programming is normally used to implement generic handler functions
that might operate on a whole collection of different objects (each
registered as a different document).

<li>In the function <tt>mandelpage()</tt>, the function
<tt>swill_getargs()</tt> is used to parse HTTP query variables and
place their values into C variables.  This is function is somewhat
similar to <tt>scanf()</tt> except that the associated format string
has to supply HTTP variable names in addition to a format conversion
code.

<li>Although it looks a little nasty, the <tt>mandelpage()</tt>
function produces raw HTML as output.  For the most part, this is done
using standard print statements.  However, a special function
<tt>swill_printurl()</tt> is used to produce URLs along with optional
query variables attached to them.  In this example, this is used to
provide links to the same page, but with modified values of the image
parameters.

</ul>
</p>


<h2><a name="HTTP Overview">5. HTTP Overview</a></h2>

<p>
To better understand how SWILL works and its programming API, it is
useful to have a basic understanding of the HTTP/1.0 protocol.  First,
in order to deliver web pages, some kind of server has to be listening
for incoming connections on a TCP port.  Normally, web servers use
port 80.  However, since port 80 is priviledged and may already be in
use, you will have to pick some other port number.  Typically you have
to pick a number greater than 1024.  For instance, the previous
examples used port 8080.
</p>

<p>
When a browser submits a request, it is sent as a simple text message
like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
GET /foo.html HTTP/1.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.73 [en] (X11; U; SunOS 5.8 sun4u)
Pragma: no-cache
Host: schlitz:8080
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language: en
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1,*,utf-8
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The first line of the request indicates the name of the document.
Subsequent lines are known as HTTP headers and contain various
information about the browser and the remote client.  The request is
terminated by a blank line (two newline characters).  For most
practical purposes, the only critical part of the request is the
document name such as <tt>/foo.html</tt>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to requesting a document, an HTTP request may also include
extra parameters known as query variables.  These are usually attached
to the URL (document name).  For example, this request

<blockquote>
<pre>
GET /foo.html?name=Dave&amp;pt=1234 HTTP/1.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.73 [en] (X11; U; SunOS 5.8 sun4u)
Pragma: no-cache
...
</pre>
</blockquote>

includes two query variables <tt>name</tt> and <tt>pt</tt>.  More
often than not, query variables show up when you start using HTML
forms.  However, they may be manually attached to any URL that you
might include in an HTML document.  Also, this string of query values
(after the <tt>?</tt>) is sometimes called a query string.
</p>

<p>
After a request has been received, the server sends back a response.
A typical response looks like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 12734

&lt;html&gt;
... rest of document ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

The first line of the response is a response code.  After the code, a
series of headers appear.  These give information about the server and
the document itself (file type, length, etc.).  The headers are
terminated by a blank line.  After that, you find the raw document
data.
</p>

<p>
That's about all there is to the basic HTTP protocol.  As one might
expect, there are more advanced aspects of the protocol related to
caching, security, and so forth.  However, it's really not necessary
to worry about this too much.
</p>


<h2><a name="Controlling the SWILL server">6. Controlling the SWILL server</a></h2>

<p>
The following functions are used to control the server.
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_init(int port)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Initializes the server and makes it start listening on the TCP port
specified in <tt>port</tt>.  If <tt>port</tt> is set to zero, the
server will simply pick any available port.  Returns the port number
on success or zero on failure.  Only one server may be active at any
given time.  Calling <tt>swill_init()</tt> more than once will
generate an assertion error.  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_shutdown()</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Shuts down the server created using <tt>swill_init()</tt>.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>char *swill_title(const char *title);</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Sets the title string used on various SWILL-generated pages.  This is
optional, but typically you would use this function to supply the name
of your application.  The function always returns the current title
string.  If the <tt>title</tt> argument is NULL, the current title is
returned.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_log(FILE *log)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Supplies a file that should be used for logging web connections.
<tt>log</tt> can be any file opened for writing with <tt>fopen()</tt>
or a related library function.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_serve()</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Waits for a single incoming web request.  The calling process is
blocked until an incoming connection is actually received.  The return
code is currently undefined.  This function returns after any request
is received.  To serve multiple requests, repeated calls must be made.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_poll()</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Polls for an incoming connection.  If a connection is found, the
resulting request is serviced.  Returns 0 if no connection was found,
1 if a request was serviced.
</blockquote>
</p>


<h2><a name="Handler functions">7. Handler functions</a></h2>

Most output generated by SWILL is produced by special handler
functions that are invoked when certain web pages are accessed.  The
official prototype of these handler functions is as follows:

<p>
<b><tt>typedef void SwillHandler(FILE *out, void *clientdata)</tt></b>
</p>

<p>
To register a handler with the server, the special
<tt>swill_handle()</tt> function is used.
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_handle(const char *url, SwillHandler *handler, void *clientdata)</tt></b>

<blockquote>
Registers a new page with the web server. <tt>url</tt> is the name of
the document that must be supplied by the user in the browser.
<tt>handler</tt> is a callback function that will be invoked when the
web page is accessed.  <tt>clientdata</tt> is a user-supplied pointer
that is passed when calling the handler function.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
When a document is registered with the server, the supplied
<tt>url</tt> is used to control a few different properties of the
server.  First, the document suffix implicitly determines the document
type.  Currently SWILL recognizes the following file types:

<blockquote>
<pre>
file.txt        Plaintext file   (text/plain)
file.htm        HTML document    (text/html)
file.html       HTML document    (text/html)
file.gif        GIF image        (image/gif)
file.png        PNG image        (image/png)
file.jpg        JPEG image       (image/jpg)
file.jpeg       JPEG image       (image/jpg)
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
If no file suffix is supplied, the file type is set to plaintext.
</p>

<p>
If the URL supplied to <tt>swill_handle()</tt> is prefixed with the
special string <tt>"stdout:"</tt>, SWILL captures all output printed
to <tt>stdout</tt> while executing the handler function and returns it
as part of the web page.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
void foo() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
}

int main() {
    ...
    swill_handle("stdout:foo.txt", foo, 0);
    ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The capturing of <tt>stdout</tt> also works in applications where you
might want to capture the output of a system command.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
void getdir() {
    system("ls -l");
}
...
int main() {
   ...
   swill_handle("stdout:getdir", getdir, 0);
   ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Using <tt>system()</tt> you could implement your own CGI mechanism.
However, be aware that executing system commands is also a significant
security risk -- make sure you never pass any sort of user input to
such an operation (otherwise the user might be able to execute
arbitrary shell commands).
</p>

<p>
The <tt>clientdata</tt> argument of handler functions is used to pass
user-defined data.  This would be used if you wanted to pass an object
to a handler function.  For example, suppose your program had the
ability to make scientific plots and you wanted to provide a variety
of web-pages.  To do this, you might write some code that looked like
this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
void make_plot(FILE *f, Plot3D *plot) {
    ...
    make_plot(plot);
    write_image(plot,f);
    ...
}

int main() {
    ...
    Plot3D *kinetic = KineticEnergyPlot();
    Plot3D *velocity = VelocityPlot();
    ...
    swill_handle("ke.gif", make_plot, kinetic);
    swill_handle("vel.gif", make_plot, velocity);
    ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>


<h2><a name="Files and directories">8. Files and directories</a></h2>

<p>
If necessary, SWILL can be programmed to return existing files.  The
following functions can be used:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>swill_file(const char *url, const char *filename)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Adds a single file to the server.  <tt>url</tt> is the name of the
document in HTTP requests.  <tt>filename</tt> is a pathname that is
relative to the current working directory of the program.  If
<tt>filename</tt> is NULL, then <tt>url</tt> is used for the filename.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>swill_directory(const char *dirname)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Sets the document root directory to <tt>dirname</tt>.  If this
function is used, it allows SWILL to serve an entire directory of
files.  Whenever an incoming request is received and the request
doesn't match the name of an existing handler or file, this directory
is searched.  Only one directory can be registered with the server at
any given time.  Furthermore, to prevent abuse, certain pathname
restrictions are enforced.  Specifically, web requests involving paths
with special pathname components of "." and ".." are handled as
errors.
</blockquote>
</p>


<h2><a name="Argument conversion and form variables">9. Argument conversion and form variables</a></h2>

<p>
In many applications, it is useful to be able to receive variables
that were supplied on HTML forms.  For example, you might have a web
page that asks a user to input some values such as this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;form action="gcd.txt" method=GET&gt;
X : &lt;input type=text name=x width=5&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Y : &lt;input type=text name=y width=5&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Submit : &lt;input type=submit&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
When the form is submitted, values for x and y will be supplied along
with the request.  To receive these variables in a handler function,
the following functions can be used:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>char *swill_getvar(const char *name)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Returns a HTTP variable <tt>name</tt> as a string.  If no such
variable exists, returns NULL.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_getargs(const char *fmt, ...)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Parses and returns a collection of form variables.  <tt>fmt</tt> is a
special format string that specifies the names and types of the
arguments.  Returns 0 on failure, 1 on success.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The <tt>swill_getargs()</tt> function is more powerful and is used as
follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
void gcd(FILE *f) {
   int x, y;
   if (!swill_getargs("i(x)i(y)",&x,&y)) {
       fprintf(f,"Error. Please supply x and y.\n");
   } else {
       /* Compute gcd */
       ...
   }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
In the example, the format string <tt>"i(x)i(y)"</tt> specifies two
integer values named x and y respectively.  The following format codes
are currently recognized:

<blockquote>
<pre>
fmt code           C datatype
------------       ---------------------------------
i(name)            signed int
l(name)            signed long
h(name)            signed short
b(name)            signed char (as a number)
I(name)            unsigned int
L(name)            unsigned long
H(name)            unsigned short
B(name)            unsigned char (as a number)
f(name)            float
d(name)            double
s(name)            char *
p(name)            void * (from an unsigned int)
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
In addition, a vertical bar "|" can be used in the format string to
indicate the start of optional arguments.
</p>

<p>
Here is a more complicated example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
char *name;
char *email;
char *address;
int   age;
...
if (!swill_getargs("s(name)s(email)s(address)|i(age)",
                    &name, &email, &address, &age)) {
   fprintf(f,"Error. Missing arguments.\n");
} else {
   /* Whatever */
   ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>


<h2><a name="SWILL I/O functions">10. SWILL I/O functions</a></h2>

<p>
Normally, SWILL output is produced using standard functions such as
<tt>printf()</tt> or <tt>fprintf()</tt>.  However, SWILL also provides
its own implementation of these functions:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_printf(const char *fmt, ...)</tt></b><br/>
<b><tt>int swill_fprintf(FILE *f, const char *fmt, ...)</tt></b><br/>
<b><tt>int swill_vprintf(const char *fmt, va_list ap)</tt></b><br/>
<b><tt>int swill_vfprintf(const char *fmt, va_list ap)</tt></b><br/>
</p>

<p>
The operation of these functions is identical to their counterparts in
the C library.  However, there is one minor enhancement.
Specifically, the SWILL I/O functions can optionally accept an
encoding parameter.  This is sometimes useful when producing HTML code
from a handler function.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
swill_fprintf(f,"foo.html?name=<b>%(url)s</b>&address=<b>%(url)s</b>", name, address);
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Notice the use of the special <tt>%(url)s</tt> format specifier.  When
used, the resulting output is formatted to produce a proper URL
encoding.  For example, a string such as "Brian Ward" will be turned
into "Brian+Ward" and special characters will be converted into escape
codes.
</p>

<p>
Currently, two encoding schemes are available:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>%(url)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Formats text so that it is safe to include in a URL as might appear as
part of a hyperlink in an HTML document.  Spaces are replaced by "+"
and special symbols are replaced by escape codes.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>%(pre)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Formats text so that it is safe to include in an HTML preformatted
text section <tt>(&lt;pre&gt;)</tt>.  Special characters such as
<tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, and <tt>&amp;</tt> are replaced by HTML
sequences <tt>&amp;lt;</tt>, <tt>&amp;gt;</tt>, and <tt>&amp;amp;</tt>
respectively.  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, you might want to generate a hyperlink to a URL along with
optional arguments.  To do this, the following function can be used:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_printurl(FILE *f, const char *url, const char *fmt, ...)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Produce a URL of the form "<tt>url?args</tt>".  <tt>url</tt> is the
URL to use in the link.  <tt>fmt</tt> is a argument format string that
is identical to that used by <tt>swill_getargs()</tt>.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of using <tt>swill_printurl()</tt>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
char *name  = "John Doe";
char *email = "john@doe.gov";
int  age    = 13;
...

fprintf(f,"&lt;a href=\"");
swill_printurl(f,"profile.html","s(name)s(email)i(age)", name, email, age);
fprintf(f,"\"&gt;User profile</a>");
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
It might come as no great surprise that there is some relationship
between <tt>swill_getargs()</tt> and <tt>swill_printurl()</tt>.  One
function is used to receive HTTP arguments whereas the other function
is used to print URLs that contain arguments.  If you're clever, you
can use this to pass data between web pages or as a simple mechanism
for remote procedure call.
</p>

<p>
When a log file has been supplied to SWILL, output can be generated
using the following function:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_logprintf(const char *fmt, ...);</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Produces output in the SWILL log file (if any).  If no file was first
supplied using <tt>swill_log()</tt>, this function does nothing.
</blockquote>
</p>


<h2><a name="HTTP Headers">11. HTTP Headers</a></h2>

<p>
In certain cases, you might want to retrieve or set HTTP headers on
each request.  For instance, when a server receives a request, it
typically looks like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
GET /foo.html HTTP/1.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.73 [en] (X11; U; SunOS 5.8 sun4u)
Pragma: no-cache
Host: schlitz:8080
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language: en
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1,*,utf-8
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The headers are the lines following the initial request lines.  To
retrieve a header, use the following function:
</p>

</p>
<b><tt>char *swill_getheader(const char *name)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Returns HTTP header <tt>name</tt>.  If the header doesn't exist,
returns NULL.  <tt>name</tt> is case-insensitive.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Here is an example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
char *host = swill_getheader("host");
char *useragent = swill_getheader("user-agent");
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
To set a header in the outgoing data, use the following:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_setheader(const char *name, const char *value)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Sets an HTTP header value in the outgoing data.  No interpretation of
<tt>name</tt> or <tt>value</tt> is made.  This simply produces an
output string of the form "<tt>name: value</tt>" in the header section
of the HTTP response.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Under normal use, it is probably not necessary to read or set the HTTP
headers.  However, this capability is provided for the sake of power
users.
</p>

<p>
If you ever need to change the HTTP response code, use the following
function:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_setresponse(const char *resp)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Sets the HTTP response code.  <tt>resp</tt> is a string such as
<tt>"404 File not found"</tt> or <tt>"501 Not implemented"</tt>.
Under normal conditions, you probably do not need to use this
function.
</blockquote>
</p>


<h2><a name="Security and reliability">12. Security and reliability</a></h2>

<p>
SWILL provides support for both HTTP basic authentication and IP
filtering.
</p>

<p>
Basic authentication is set using the following function:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_user(const char *username, const char *passwd)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Enables basic authorization.  Once called, all subsequent accesses
will require a username and password.  May be called more than once to
register different users.  In basic authorization, the user name and
password are essentially sent in clear-text in HTTP requests.
Therefore, you should not use a sensitive password or your login
password with this function.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
IP filters can be set using the following functions:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_deny(const char *ip)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Adds an IP address to the deny list.  If an incoming connection is
received from this address, the network connection is immediately
closed.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_allow(const char *ip)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Adds an IP address to the allow list.  If an address is allowed, it
takes precedence over any address that might be denied using
<tt>swill_deny()</tt>.  Also, calling <tt>swill_allow()</tt>
implicitly causes swill to deny all accesses except for those supplied
to this function.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The IP filters use substring matching on the dotted-numerical
representation of an IP address.  Here are some examples:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/* Only allow connections from 128.135.11.44 */
swill_allow("128.135.11.44");  
 
/* Allow connections from a subnet */
swill_allow("128.135.11.");

/* Deny connections from a bad machine */
swill_deny("128.135.11.13");

/* Deny connections from a subnet */
swill_deny("128.135.4.");

/* Deny connections from everywhere */
swill_deny("");
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Since SWILL is a single-threaded web-server, a number of mechanisms
are in place to help prevent reliability problems.  First, SWILL will
automatically close a connection whenever requests appear to be
malformed or suspicious.  Second, timeouts are used to help prevent
lock-ups due to unresponsive clients or clients that open connections,
but which don't send any data.  This timeout is set to 10 seconds by
default.  However, it can be changed using the following function:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>swill_timeout(int seconds)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Set the timeout tolerance for data transmission. Read/write operations
that take longer than this time will result in a termination of the
connection.
</blockquote>
</p>


<h2><a name="SSL">13. SSL</a></h2>

<p>
SWILL provides support for SSL through the use of OpenSSL, under all
platforms supported.  Of course, you are responsible for properly
installing OpenSSL in a way that your environment can find all
required files (headers, libraries, etc.), both at compilation and run
time, as well as creating any certificates required for proper OpenSSL
operation (the explanation of which is beyond this document).
</p>

<p>
The SSL support is provided through these functions:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_init_ssl(int port, int ssl, const char* tmpdir)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
This is the same as the old style <tt>swill_init(int port)</tt> but
with two additional parameters:

<ul>
<li><tt>ssl</tt>: set to 1 if you want to use SSL, 0 otherwise.
<li><tt>tmpdir</tt>: specify a path for temporary files to be created,
or 0 to use the system default path.
</ul>

The old style <tt>swill_init(port)</tt> is now a preprocessor define
that calls <tt>swill_init_ssl(port, 0, 0)</tt>.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_ssl_set_certfile(const char* crtfile, const char* keyfile, swill_ssl_pwd_getter pcb)</tt></b>

<blockquote>
This call tells SWILL where your certificate file and its
corresponding key file are located, and provides a callback function
that will be called to retrieve the pass phrase for the key; this
function must have the prototype <tt>int swill_ssl_pwd_getter(char*
buf, int maxlen)</tt>, receiving a preallocated buffer <tt>buf</tt>
with a maximum length of <tt>maxlen</tt>, which should place the pass
phrase into <tt>buf</tt> and return its actual length. An example of
such a function could be:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<tt>
<pre>
static int pwd_getter(char* buf, int maxlen)
{
   strcpy(buf, "NOT-SO-VERY-SECRET");
   return strlen(buf);
}
</pre>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>


<h2><a name="Using MPI">14. Using MPI</a></h2>

<p>
Using SWILL to add a webserver to an MPI program should not be
difficult.  That being said, SWILL has been designed with a certain
execution model in mind (SPMD style programs, to be precise), and it
may take slightly more to make it work with a parallel application
that is doing funny things.  The most important rule of thumb is this:
most <tt>swill_*()</tt> calls are made within a global context.  That
is to say, they should either be in a part of the code that is not
rank-dependent, or they should be duplicated across rank-dependent
parts of the code so that they are called by everyone.
</p>

<p>
It is probably easier to explain this using a very simple example:

<blockquote>
<tt>
<pre>
#include "mpi.h"
#include "swill.h"

int r;
void foo()
{ printf("foo %d\n", r); }

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD,&r);

swill_init(8887);
swill_handle("stdout:foo.txt", foo, NULL);

while(1){
        sleep(5);
        swill_poll();
}
return 0;
}
</pre>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
To begin with, SWILL expects the host application to initialize MPI
(<tt>MPI_Init()</tt>).  If the user doesn't do it, SWILL will not do
it for her.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, <tt>swill_init()</tt> must be called.  In this case it gets
called in code that is not rank-dependent -- indeed, the whole example
is rank-independent.  If there are other rank-dependent
initializations that need to be performed, then <tt>swill_init()</tt>
can be called along with them, so long as it has been called on every
node before any other <tt>swill_*()</tt> call.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, <tt>swill_handle()</tt> gets called, also in a
rank-independent context, to register a function callback.
</p>

<p>
Then we enter our loop, which in this case performs no
computation.  Again in a rank-independent context, we call
<tt>swill_poll()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
What happens under the hood when <tt>swill_poll()</tt> is called is
this (let's call the node with rank == 0 the "master node"):
</p>

<ul>

<li>the master node checks for a pending connection. 

<ul>

<li>If there is no pending connection, all nodes are instructed to
continue with their computation, and we're done.

<li>If there is a connection other than an authentication request or a
request for a file from the filesystem, the master node broadcasts it
to all nodes.

<li>If authentication is being requested, the master node
authenticates the user, instructs the rest to continue, and we're
done.

<li>If a file from the filesystem is requested, again, the master node
authenticates the user, instructs the rest to continue, and we're
done.

</ul>

<li>all nodes compute the desired output.  In rank order, each node
sends back the resulting output to the master.

<li>the master collects the output in rank order, and writes it to the
socket.  Computation continues where it left off.

</ul>
</p>

<p>
So, then, in an MPI application, calling a <tt>swill_poll()</tt> is
equivalent to performing a barrier synchronization.  That is because
the master node has to broadcast at least one piece of information,
i.e. whether there is a pending request that requires every node's
output, or not.
</p>

<p>
Notice that no formatting or designation of output by rank number or
anything of that sort is done.  This sort of functionality is up to
the user to implement.
