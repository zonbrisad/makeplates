Version 0.1
===========
4/3/2002: beazley
          Changed swill_close() to swill_shutdown().  Suggested
          by Pat Tullmann.

2/21/2002: beazley
           Modified the build process.  SWILL now builds as a shared
           library libswill.so.  An optional I/O filter library
           can be built in the Source/Filter library.  If compiled,
           this creates a library libswillc.so.
